1.  Drag the Twitch Notifications Folder onto your desktop.
2.  Download notepad++ from https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/ 
    Click whatever version is at the top, and then click the green download button and run the installer.
3.  Put all of the gifs that you are going to use in the gifs folder. 
4.  Right click main.html and click Edit with Notepad++.
5.  In line 6, change "gifs/sparkling.gif" to the name of the default gif. 
    For example, if the gif of vulpix just sitting there is called "x", line 6 should say: <img src= "gifs/x.gif" id="defaultGif">
6.  Save the file.
7.  Go to streamlabs.com, go to your dashboard, and at the left side on the bottom under Account click on Settings.
8.  Click on API Settings.
9.  Click on API Tokens.
10. Click copy on the bar that says "Your Socket API Token".
11. Right click on main.js and click Edit With Notepad++.
12. In line 1, paste your API Token between the ''. 
    For example, if your API Token was asdjhaskdhsajk, it should say: const socketToken = 'asdjhaskdhsajk';
13. In lines 4-10, change each "gifs/name.gif" to the names of your gif to the coressponding alert type.
    If the name of your follow gif is "x" change line 4 to var followGif = "gifs/x.gif";
    If the name of your sub gif is "y" change line 5 to var subGif = "gifs/y.gif";
    And so on.
14. For lines 12-17, change each number to the length of that specific gif in milliseconds.
    1 second = 1000 milliseconds.    
    If your follow gif is 3 seconds long, line 12 should say: var followGifLength = 3000;
    If your sub gif is 5 seconds long, line 13 should say: var subGifLength = 5000;
    And so on. 
15. Save the file. 
16. In OBS, drag the main.html file into the window and it should add it as a source.
    If it doesn't let you do this, you can click the plus sign, add a new browser source, and for the url put the location of the main.html file.
    To get the location of the main.html file, you can open it in Google Chrome and the location will be in the address bar. 
    It should be something like file:///C:/Users/Frank/Desktop/Twitch%20Notifications/main.html
    Once that's done, you can close the tab in Google Chrome, it does not need to be open.
17. To color key out the background, right click on the source and click filters.
18. Under effect filters click the plus button and click color key. 
    You can name the filter whatever you want or just keep the default name.
19. Next to Key Color Type, select Custom Color.
20. Click select color, and in the bottom right in the box next to HTML:, put 56ff00.

I included a png of a heart in the folder. It doesn't do anything. I just put it there to show this was done out of love. 

If in the future you ever want to change one of the gifs:
Go to the line that relates to the alert type, and change the name like in Step 13.
Then change the length of the gif like in Step 14.
Then all you have to do is delete the source from OBS, and go through Steps 16-20 in order to update it.

I tried to be as detailed as possible. Let me know if you have any questions, or just call me and I will walk you through setting it up.
